# Documentation and Local Test Task List

## Steps
- [x] Create `docs/ai/` folder in the root directory of the project.
- [x] Read the hidden `task.md` and `implementation_plan.md` files up to now and copy them to this new `docs/ai/` directory.
- [x] Create an `AI_CONTEXT.md` (or .cursorrules) file summarizing the application architecture (D1, Hono, Hive, Repository Pattern).
- [x] Add this `docs/` folder to the `git` repository in the project and commit.
- [x] Test localhost via Swagger (Local control steps).
